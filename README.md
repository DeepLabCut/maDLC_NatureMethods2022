## Quick start:

- git clone this folder `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/maDLC_NatureMethods2022.git`

- we suggest using the [deeplabcut conda environment](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html#conda-the-installation-process-is-as-easy-as-this-figure), as then all (and more) dependencies are met. Thus, activate the environment and navigate into the cloned folder.

- from the terminal launch `jupyter notebook` and select the Figure you wish to explore.
