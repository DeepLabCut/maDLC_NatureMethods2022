**TRI-MOUSE:** [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB/COLAB_3miceDemo.ipynb)

**MARMOSETS:** pending

**FISH:** pending 

**PARENTING:** pending


Note: these projects are tailored to these specific datasets, therefore running inference on other (differently looking) videos is unlikely to work.
